* Introduction

The rapidly increasing volume and complexity of data in today's digital world require innovative approaches to data storage, sharing, and analysis. Dialog, a distributed, append-only graph database, aims to address these challenges by providing a decentralized platform for public and open data. By allowing data sources to contribute information and consumers to choose the data they want to consume, Dialog enables seamless collaboration and exchange of information across various domains and industries.

* Overview of Dialog

** The Need for Dialog

As the volume and complexity of data continue to grow in today's digital world, there is an increasing demand for a platform that enables efficient and secure sharing of public and open data. Dialog was developed in response to this need, providing a decentralized solution for data storage, sharing, and analysis, while ensuring data integrity and privacy.

** Key Features

Dialog offers several key features that make it suitable for handling public and open data across various domains and industries:
- *Decentralized architecture*, using IPFS to ensure data integrity and security
- *Append-only design*, facilitating updates and corrections by appending new links to mark previous data as incorrect and provide corrected information, similar to follow-up commits in version control systems like Git
- *Flexible data structures*, enabling the representation of complex relationships and various types of data

* Data Structures in Dialog

Dialog utilizes three primary data structures: nodes, link types, and links.
- *Nodes* represent singular entities, identified by a cryptographic hash of their content. They consist of a short name and a longer description.
- *Link types* define relationships between nodes, using human-readable sentences with named blanks. The number of blanks determines the arity of the link type.
- *Links* represent statements connecting nodes, stored as tuples of IDs and typed scalars. The first ID corresponds to a link type, followed by IDs that map to other data types or nodes.

* Data Handling and Integrity

Dialog manages data updates and corrections through follow-up additions, using specific link types to indicate changes, such as deduplication or marking outdated information. To protect data integrity, Dialog leverages IPFS, which uses content IDs to verify authenticity and prevents counterfeit data. Privacy and security are ensured by keeping private data on the devices they were created on, only leaving the device when encrypted.

* Use Cases and Target Industries

Dialog offers a wide range of applications across various sectors, both for public and open data and for-profit corporations.
